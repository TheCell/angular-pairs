# Angular Memory Game

This project was originally planned to contain a backend and a frontend part. In the end it was angular only. That's why we have a subfolder.

# Getting started
Clone the project and open the subfolder in Visual Studio Code.

I am using the Angular extension plugins in VS Code. How to setup the Angular project is in the readme in the subfolder.
